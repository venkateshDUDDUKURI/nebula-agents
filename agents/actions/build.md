# Action: Build

## User Intent

Implement planned features by generating production-quality code, tests, and deployment configurations with comprehensive review and approval gates.

## Agent Flow

```
Architect (Implementation Orchestration)
  ↓
(Backend Developer + Frontend Developer + AI Engineer [if AI scope] + Quality Engineer + DevOps)
  ↓ [Parallel Implementation]
[SELF-REVIEW GATE: Each agent validates their work]
  ↓
Code Reviewer
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews code quality]
  ↓
Security
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews security findings]
  ↓
[SIGNOFF GATE: required reviewer evidence verified]
  ↓
[PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT: delivered-feature reconciliation]
  ↓
[TRACKER SYNC GATE: trackers and story index validated]
  ↓
Build Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Mixed (architect-led orchestration kickoff, parallel implementation, sequential reviews with approval gates, required signoff verification, PM closeout, and final tracker sync)

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates roles, gates, and artifact flow. Keep it stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Store executable evidence (test, lint, SAST, dependency scan outputs) under solution artifacts and use it in review gates.

---

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Architect-Led Assembly Planning

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Architect agent** by reading `agents/architect/SKILL.md`
2. **Read context:**
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md`
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/` (feature folders with colocated stories)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md`
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/`
3. **Produce assembly plan:**
   - Build order for vertical slices
   - Explicit backend/frontend/AI handoffs
   - Integration checkpoints for QA and DevOps
   - Clear definition of "done" for each slice
4. **Output artifact:**
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/architecture/application-assembly-plan.md` (use `agents/templates/application-assembly-plan-template.md`)

**Completion Criteria for Step 0:**
- [ ] Application assembly plan exists
- [ ] Scope split across implementation agents is explicit
- [ ] Integration checkpoints defined

---

### Step 0.5: Assembly Plan Validation

**Execution Instructions:**

Validate the assembly plan before parallel implementation begins:

- [ ] Scope split matches story requirements
- [ ] Dependencies between agents are identified

   Review Details:
   [Link to security review report]
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

2. **Present approval checklist:**
   ```
   Security Approval Checklist:

   - [ ] Authorization correctly implemented
   - [ ] No hardcoded secrets
   - [ ] Audit logging complete
   - [ ] Input validation comprehensive
   ```

3. **Enforce security gate based on findings severity:**

   **Gate Decision Logic:**

   The security gate enforces different rules based on severity of findings:

   ```
   IF critical_issues > 0:
     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     MESSAGE: "Critical security issues MUST be fixed. Cannot proceed."
     OPTIONS: ["Fix Critical Issues", "Cancel Build"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF high_issues > 0:
     STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
     MESSAGE: "High-severity security issues found. Recommend fixing before approval."
     OPTIONS: ["Fix Issues (Recommended)", "Approve with Justification", "Cancel Build"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true (requires justification)

   ELSE IF medium_issues > 0 OR low_issues > 0:
     STATUS: ✓ ACCEPTABLE
     MESSAGE: "Only medium/low severity issues found. Safe to approve."
     OPTIONS: ["Approve", "Fix Issues Anyway", "Cancel Build"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true

   ELSE:
     STATUS: ✓ CLEAN
     MESSAGE: "No security issues found. Safe to proceed."
     OPTIONS: ["Approve"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true
   ```

4. **Present gate to user with appropriate options:**

   **Scenario A: Critical Issues Found (BLOCKING)**
   ```
   ❌ SECURITY GATE: BLOCKED

   Critical security issues found:
   - [CRITICAL] SQL Injection vulnerability in CustomerController.cs:45
   - [CRITICAL] Hardcoded API key in appsettings.json:12

   High severity issues:
   - [HIGH] Missing authentication on /api/admin endpoint

   ❌ Cannot proceed until critical issues are resolved.

   Options:
   [Fix Critical Issues] [Cancel Build]
   ```

   **Handling:**
   - **"Fix Critical Issues":**
     - Return to appropriate developer agents to fix issues
     - Re-run Security review (return to Step 5)
     - Repeat until critical issues = 0

   - **"Cancel Build":**
     - Abort build action
     - User can restart with `build` action later

   ---

   **Scenario B: High Issues Only (WARNING - Approval Requires Justification)**
   ```
   ⚠️ SECURITY GATE: WARNING

   High severity issues found:
   - [HIGH] Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - [HIGH] Weak password policy (min length: 6)

   Medium/Low issues:
   - [MEDIUM] CORS policy too permissive
   - [LOW] Missing security headers

   ⚠️ Recommend fixing high-severity issues before approval.

   Options:
   [Fix Issues (Recommended)] [Approve with Justification] [Cancel Build]
   ```

   **Handling:**
   - **"Fix Issues (Recommended)":**
     - Return to developer agents to fix issues
     - Re-run Security review

   - **"Approve with Justification":**
     - Require user to provide justification:
       ```
       Why are you approving with high-severity issues?
       [ User enters reason: "These are planned for Phase 2 per ADR-015" ]
       ```
     - Log approval decision with justification to audit trail
     - Proceed to Step 6.75 (Signoff Gate)

   - **"Cancel Build":**
     - Abort build action

   ---

   **Scenario C: Medium/Low Issues Only (ACCEPTABLE)**
   ```
   ✓ SECURITY GATE: ACCEPTABLE

   Medium severity issues:
   - [MEDIUM] CORS policy could be more restrictive
   - [MEDIUM] Session timeout could be shorter

   Low severity issues:
   - [LOW] Missing X-Content-Type-Options header
   - [LOW] Verbose error messages in dev mode

   ✓ No critical or high-severity issues. Safe to approve.

   Options:
   [Approve] [Fix Issues Anyway] [Cancel Build]
   ```

   **Handling:**
   - **"Approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 6.75 (Signoff Gate)

   - **"Fix Issues Anyway":**
     - Return to developer agents to fix issues
     - Re-run Security review

   - **"Cancel Build":**
     - Abort build action

   ---

   **Scenario D: No Issues (CLEAN)**
   ```
   ✓ SECURITY GATE: CLEAN

   No security issues found.

   ✅ All security checks passed:
   - No SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Authentication properly implemented
   - Authorization enforced on all endpoints
   - Input validation comprehensive
   - OWASP Top 10 compliance verified

   Options:
   [Approve]
   ```

   **Handling:**
   - **"Approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 6.75 (Signoff Gate)

5. **Machine-Readable Gate State:**

   Orchestrators must be able to programmatically determine gate state:

   ```json
   {
     "gate": "security_review",
     "status": "blocked" | "warning" | "acceptable" | "clean",
     "findings": {
       "critical": 2,
       "high": 1,
       "medium": 3,
       "low": 5
     },
     "can_approve": false,
     "requires_justification": false,
     "available_actions": ["fix_critical_issues", "cancel"],
     "blocking_issues": [
       {
         "severity": "critical",
         "type": "sql_injection",
         "location": "CustomerController.cs:45",
         "description": "Unsanitized user input in SQL query"
       },
       {
         "severity": "critical",
         "type": "hardcoded_secret",
         "location": "appsettings.json:12",
         "description": "API key hardcoded in configuration"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Gate Criteria (Enforcement Rules):**
- ❌ **BLOCKED:** If critical issues > 0, approval is DISABLED (no override possible)
- ⚠️ **WARNING:** If high issues > 0 (and critical = 0), approval ENABLED but requires justification
- ✓ **ACCEPTABLE:** If only medium/low issues, approval ENABLED without restriction
- ✓ **CLEAN:** If no issues, approval ENABLED

**Contract Compliance:**
This security gate enforcement aligns with the orchestration contract quality-gate model:
- Critical issues = Block (must be fixed, no override) ✅
- High issues = Warn (user can approve with justification) ✅
- Medium/Low issues = Acceptable (proceed, track for later) ✅

**Audit Log Requirements:**
- Log all gate decisions with timestamp, user, severity counts
- For "Approve with Justification", log the justification text
- For "Fix Critical Issues", log which issues were identified
- Append to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/.audit/gate-decisions.jsonl`

**Example Audit Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "gate": "security_review",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-07T15:30:00Z",
  "user": "user@example.com",
  "decision": "blocked",
  "findings": {
    "critical": 2,
    "high": 1,
    "medium": 3,
    "low": 5
  },
  "action_taken": "fix_critical_issues",
  "blocking_issues": [
    "SQL Injection in CustomerController.cs:45",
    "Hardcoded API key in appsettings.json:12"
  ]
}
```

### Step 6.5: Performance Validation (Informational)

**Execution Instructions:**

If `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` Section 4 defines measurable NFR targets, validate implementation against them and record results:

- [ ] API latency target (for example p95)
- [ ] Throughput/concurrency target
- [ ] Frontend performance targets (for example Core Web Vitals) when applicable

This is an informational gate for release readiness reporting and does not block progression by itself.

---

### Step 6.75: SIGNOFF GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Before Build Complete, verify required role signoffs across delivered features:

1. Read `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md` for each delivered feature:
   - `Required Signoff Roles` matrix
   - `Story Signoff Provenance`
2. For every required role across the build scope, confirm:
   - each in-scope story has a passing signoff row
   - reviewer/date/evidence are present
   - evidence paths point to solution artifacts, not `agents/**`
3. If any required signoff is missing or non-pass:
   - Block build closeout
   - Route back to the owning reviewer role

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Every required signoff role has a passing ledger entry for delivered scope
- [ ] Signoff evidence is complete for every in-scope story
- [ ] No feature is marked `Done`/`Archived` without passing required signoffs

---

### Step 6.9: PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Product Manager agent** by reading `agents/product-manager/SKILL.md`
2. Reconcile delivered-feature closure artifacts:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md` for each delivered feature
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` for status/path transitions
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` for sequencing/completion placement
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` feature/story status snapshot (if changed)
3. For completed features, move folders to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/archive/` when appropriate and update impacted path references
4. If ontology-backed planning exists for touched features, update feature/path/status references in:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
5. Record deferred follow-ups, known mitigations, and orphaned story handling before tracker validation
6. **Knowledge-graph validation:**
   - Confirm implementation agents added `code-index.yaml` bindings for new source files created during the build. If bindings are missing, add them now.
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` and resolve any errors before proceeding.
   - If the build introduced new canonical nodes or rationale entries, confirm they are present in `canonical-nodes.yaml`.
   - Regenerate and validate the symbol layer: `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols`. Editing a bound method body without first consulting `lookup.py --symbol` (or `hint.py --symbol`) is forbidden — the symbol-layer routing aid keeps edits narrow.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Product Manager closeout executed after signoff passed
- [ ] Delivered features have final status/archive decisions recorded
- [ ] Deferred follow-ups and mitigation carry-overs captured
- [ ] Ontology feature mappings updated if closeout changes feature path/status
- [ ] Code-index bindings exist for new source files introduced during this build
- [ ] `validate.py --check-drift` exits 0
- [ ] `validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols` exits 0

---

### Step 6.95: TRACKER SYNC GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Validate the closeout updates before Build Complete:

1. Regenerate story index when story files changed:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`

2. Validate tracker coherence:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py`

3. If validation fails:
   - Treat as blocking
   - Fix tracker drift and re-run until passing

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] STATUS files updated for delivered features
- [ ] Product Manager closeout executed before tracker validation
- [ ] REGISTRY/ROADMAP/BLUEPRINT synchronized
- [ ] STORY-INDEX regenerated when required
- [ ] Tracker validation passes

---

## Prerequisites

Before running build action:
- [ ] Plan action completed (requirements + architecture defined)
- [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md exists and is up-to-date
- [ ] Tracker governance contract available (`{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/TRACKER-GOVERNANCE.md`, seeded from `agents/templates/tracker-governance-template.md` when missing)
- [ ] User stories have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User is available for approval gates

---

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [plan action](./plan.md) - Define what to build
- **Alternative:** [feature action](./feature.md) - Build single feature incrementally
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Generate documentation
- **Quality:** [test action](./test.md) - Additional testing focus
- **Quality:** [review action](./review.md) - Additional review focus

---

## Notes

- Build action implements ALL features in scope (use feature action for incremental)
- Implementation agents work in parallel for efficiency
- Reviews are sequential to ensure quality gates
- Critical issues block approval; high issues require explicit mitigation justification if approved
- Can re-run steps if approval gates fail
- All patterns in SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md must be followed
- Signoff must pass before PM closeout, and PM closeout must finish before final tracker sync
