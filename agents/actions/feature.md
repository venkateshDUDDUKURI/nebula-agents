# Action: Feature

## User Intent

Build a single feature as a complete vertical slice (backend + frontend + tests + deployability checks) that can be deployed and tested independently. Ideal for incremental delivery.

## Agent Flow

```
Architect (Implementation Orchestration)
  ↓
(Backend Developer + Frontend Developer + AI Engineer [if AI scope] + Quality Engineer + DevOps)
  ↓ [Parallel Implementation]
[SELF-REVIEW GATE: Each agent validates their work]
  ↓
Code Reviewer + Security
  ↓ [Parallel Reviews]
[Review Gate: resolve critical findings]
  ↓
[APPROVAL GATE: User reviews and approves]
  ↓
[SIGNOFF GATE: required reviewer evidence verified]
  ↓
[PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT: status, archive, follow-up reconciliation]
  ↓
[TRACKER SYNC GATE: trackers and story index validated]
  ↓
Feature Complete
```

**Flow Type:** Mixed (architect-led orchestration kickoff, parallel implementation including deployability checks, parallel code+security reviews, single approval gate, required signoff verification, PM closeout, and final tracker sync; AI Engineer runs when feature includes AI scope)

---

## Retrieval Contract

Retuned by `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/eval.py`; do not hand-edit without running eval.

```yaml
tier_defaults:
  feature:
    clean:           { start_tier: 1, max_auto_tier: 2 }
    drift-reconcile: { start_tier: 3, max_auto_tier: 4 }
```

- `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/lookup.py <feature-id>` is a first-pass scope resolver and retrieval aid, not an authoritative source of truth.
- Raw artifacts win on conflict: `feature-assembly-plan.md`, stories, ADRs, API contracts, schemas, and policy artifacts outrank KG output.
- Navigate instead of eager-loading: open linked raw artifacts only when the current gate, review, or drift repair needs them.

## Context Files

Load in this order when the work is feature-scoped:

1. `agents/ROUTER.md`
2. `agents/agent-map.yaml`
3. `agents/docs/AGENT-USE.md`
4. `agents/actions/feature.md`
5. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/feature-assembly-plan.md`
6. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/solution-ontology.yaml`
7. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/canonical-nodes.yaml`
8. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
9. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/code-index.yaml`
10. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/coverage-report.yaml`
11. `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/**`

## On-Demand Paths

- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/api/<openapi-spec>.yaml`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/authorization-matrix.md`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/security/policies/policy.csv`
- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/*.yaml` beyond what `lookup.py` already returned
- `agents/<role>/references/**` only after a matching `agents/ROUTER.md` row

## Primary Spec

- `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/feature-assembly-plan.md` is the canonical execution spec for feature implementation
- When the assembly plan conflicts with raw story text, follow the feature assembly plan and log the reconciliation

## Ownership Contract

- `product-manager` owns feature closeout, trackers, `STATUS.md` final state, archive moves, and `feature-mappings.yaml` path/status updates
- `architect` owns `feature-assembly-plan.md`, ADRs, canonical shared semantics, API contracts, schemas, and authorization artifacts
- Implementation roles edit their runtime layers and shared feature evidence surfaces only
- Shared-semantics changes route back to `architect`; other roles flag drift instead of redefining it

## Forbidden

- Hand-enumerating schemas, ADRs, or contract files when `lookup.py` output is available
- Treating lookup/KG mappings as authoritative over raw artifacts
- Editing code without prior `hint.py <path>`
- Editing a bound method body without prior `lookup.py --symbol <name>` (or `hint.py --symbol <name>`)
- Editing shared semantics without prior `blast.py <node-id>`
- Continuing after a runtime-blocked failure without re-running runtime preflight
- Skipping any gate from `G0` through `G4.7`
- Declaring done without the explicit Product Manager role switch at `G4.6`
- Widening scope outside the current feature
- Climbing past `max_auto_tier` without recording `workstate.py escalate`

## Gate Contract

- `G0 ARCHITECT ASSEMBLY PLAN VALIDATION` — Step 0 and Step 0.5
- `G1 RUNTIME PREFLIGHT` — Runtime Preflight & Failure Triage
- `G2 SELF-REVIEW` — Step 2 Agent Validation
- `G3 CODE + SECURITY REVIEW` — Step 3 Parallel Reviews
- `G4 APPROVAL` — Step 4 Feature Review
- `G4.5 SIGNOFF` — Step 4.5 Required reviewer evidence verification
- `G4.6 PM CLOSEOUT` — Step 4.6 Product Manager closeout and archive reconciliation
- `G4.7 TRACKER SYNC` — Step 4.7 Final tracker validation

## Stop Conditions

- Runtime preflight fails and cannot be restored
- A critical code or security finding remains after one review cycle
- Required signoff is missing reviewer, date, or evidence
- A non-architect attempts to edit architect-owned canonical semantics
- Scope drifts outside the declared feature boundary
- `validate.py` or `validate.py --check-drift` fails and cannot be repaired within scope
- `INSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT`: `lookup.py` returns empty scope for a declared in-scope node, or only ambiguous / low-confidence (`inferred`, `confidence < 0.5`) matches on a node about to be edited, or the workflow needs to climb past `max_auto_tier`; halt the current gate, invoke `workstate.py escalate <reason> --nodes ... --opened-raw ...`, open the raw artifacts, and do not proceed with weak matches

## Exit Validation

Run in this order:

1. Applicable backend / frontend / AI / QE runtime commands for changed surfaces, with evidence paths recorded under `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/**`
2. `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py`
3. `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/` when stories changed
4. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols` when code in bound files changed
5. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --write-coverage-report` when KG changed
6. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-symbols`
7. `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift`
8. `python3 agents/scripts/validate_templates.py`

---

## Runtime Execution Boundary

- The builder runtime orchestrates feature flow and gates; keep it stack-agnostic.
- Stack-specific compile/test/lint/security execution must run in application runtime containers (or CI jobs built from those container definitions).
- Review and approval decisions must cite evidence produced by those application runtime executions.

## Runtime Preflight & Failure Triage (Mandatory)

Before any compile/test/lint/security scan command:

1. Verify required application runtime containers/jobs are running and healthy.
   - Example (containerized stacks): `docker compose ps` + health checks/log probe.
   - Non-containerized stacks: run the equivalent runtime readiness command(s).
2. Record preflight evidence path (command + timestamp + result) in the feature execution log.
3. If runtime is unavailable, restore runtime first, then re-run preflight before executing feature validation commands.

If a validation command fails with runtime symptoms (for example connection refused, DNS/network resolution errors, dependency service unavailable, missing container):

1. **Stop code edits immediately.**
2. Classify failure as `runtime-blocked` in feature execution notes.
3. Re-run runtime preflight and restore runtime health.
4. Re-run the same failed validation command **without code changes**.
5. Only treat it as a code defect if failure persists after runtime is healthy.

   - [ ] Unit tests passing for feature logic
   - [ ] Integration tests passing for feature endpoints
   - [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md followed
   - [ ] Feature acceptance criteria met

   - [ ] Feature deployability checks executed in application runtime containers
   - [ ] Runtime config/env-var changes documented and versioned
   - [ ] No runtime orchestration regressions introduced by the feature

**If any self-review fails:**
- Agent fixes issues
- Re-runs self-review
- Repeats until passing

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Architect confirms feature output matches Step 0 plan
- [ ] All required agents pass self-review for feature
- [ ] All feature tests passing in application runtime containers
- [ ] Runtime preflight evidence attached for failed and passing validation runs
- [ ] Feature deployability evidence recorded by DevOps

     STATUS: ❌ BLOCKED
     OPTIONS: ["fix critical", "reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: false

   ELSE IF total_high > 0:
     STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING

     APPROVE_ENABLED: true (requires justification)

   ELSE:
     STATUS: ✓ ACCEPTABLE
     OPTIONS: ["approve", "fix issues", "reject"]
     APPROVE_ENABLED: true
   ```

4. **Handle user response:**
   - **If "fix critical":**
     - Identify critical issues to fix
     - Agents fix issues
     - Return to Step 3 (re-run code and security reviews)

   - **If "fix issues":**
     - Identify selected issues to fix
     - Agents fix issues
     - Return to Step 3 (re-run code and security reviews)

   - **If "approve with justification":**
     - Capture explicit mitigation justification for remaining high issues
     - Log decision with mitigation plan
     - Proceed to Step 4.5 (Signoff Gate)

   - **If "approve":**
     - Proceed to Step 4.5 (Signoff Gate)

   - **If "reject":**
     - Capture feedback
     - Return to Step 0 (re-plan and re-implement feature)

   - **If user input is not in current state's allowed options:**
     - Do not transition
     - Re-present current state and allowed options

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Code + security critical issues = 0 before approval is enabled
- [ ] High issues fixed or approved with explicit mitigation justification
- [ ] Feature is complete vertical slice
- [ ] User decision recorded with rationale when required

---

### Step 4.5: SIGNOFF GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Before setting feature status to `Done` or moving to archive, verify role signoffs:

1. Read `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md`:
   - `Required Signoff Roles` matrix (planning baseline)
   - `Story Signoff Provenance` (execution evidence)
2. For every role marked `Required = Yes`, confirm ledger has:
   - a row per story in scope
   - `PASS` (or `APPROVED`) verdict
   - reviewer identity
   - review date
   - concrete evidence path(s) to solution artifacts under `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/operations/evidence/**`
3. If any required role is missing or non-pass:
   - Block feature closeout
   - Route back to the owning reviewer role
4. Only after all required signoffs pass:
   - Proceed to Product Manager closeout

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Every required signoff role has a passing ledger entry
- [ ] Every required signoff includes reviewer/date/evidence
- [ ] No `Done`/`Archived` transition occurs without passing required signoffs

---

### Step 4.6: PRODUCT MANAGER CLOSEOUT (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

1. **Activate Product Manager agent** by reading `agents/product-manager/SKILL.md`
2. Reconcile feature closure artifacts:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/STATUS.md` (final status, deferred follow-ups, mitigation notes)
   - `STATUS.md` required signoff matrix + story signoff provenance entries
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/REGISTRY.md` (status/path transitions, including archive moves)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/ROADMAP.md` (Now/Next/Later/Completed placement)
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/BLUEPRINT.md` (feature/story status labels and links, if changed)
3. For completed features (`Overall Status: Done`), move the feature folder to archive when appropriate:
   - From `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/F{NNNN}-{slug}/`
   - To `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/archive/F{NNNN}-{slug}/`
   - Then update impacted feature-local links and registry paths
4. If ontology-backed planning exists for the feature, update feature/path/status references in:
   - `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/knowledge-graph/feature-mappings.yaml`
5. Record any orphaned stories, deferred follow-ups, or explicit mitigation carry-overs before final validation
6. **Knowledge-graph validation:**
   - Confirm implementation agents added `code-index.yaml` bindings for new source files created during the feature. If bindings are missing, add them now.
   - Run `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --check-drift` and resolve any errors before proceeding.
   - If the feature introduced new canonical nodes or rationale entries, confirm they are present in `canonical-nodes.yaml`.
   - Regenerate and validate the symbol layer: `python3 {PRODUCT_ROOT}/scripts/kg/validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols`. Editing a bound method body without first consulting `lookup.py --symbol` (or `hint.py --symbol`) is forbidden — the symbol-layer routing aid keeps edits narrow.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Product Manager closeout executed after signoff passed
- [ ] Final feature status and archive decision recorded
- [ ] Deferred follow-ups and mitigation notes captured
- [ ] Ontology feature mapping updated if closeout changes feature path/status
- [ ] Code-index bindings exist for new source files introduced by this feature
- [ ] `validate.py --check-drift` exits 0
- [ ] `validate.py --regenerate-symbols --check-symbols` exits 0

---

### Step 4.7: TRACKER SYNC GATE (Mandatory)

**Execution Instructions:**

Validate the closeout updates before declaring feature completion:

1. Regenerate story rollup when story files changed:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/generate-story-index.py {PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/`

2. Validate consistency:
   - `python3 agents/product-manager/scripts/validate-trackers.py`

3. If validation fails:
   - Treat as a blocking issue
   - Fix tracker drift and re-run validation before completion

**Gate Criteria:**
- [ ] Feature STATUS reflects final approved state
- [ ] Product Manager closeout executed before tracker validation
- [ ] Completed feature folders are moved to `{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/archive/`
- [ ] REGISTRY/ROADMAP/BLUEPRINT are synchronized
- [ ] STORY-INDEX regenerated if story files changed
- [ ] Tracker validation passes

---

## Prerequisites

Before running feature action:
- [ ] Plan action completed for this feature
- [ ] Feature has clear user stories with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Feature scope is small (2-5 days of work)
- [ ] SOLUTION-PATTERNS.md exists
- [ ] Tracker governance contract available (`{PRODUCT_ROOT}/planning-mds/features/TRACKER-GOVERNANCE.md`, seeded from `agents/templates/tracker-governance-template.md` when missing)
- [ ] AI scope is explicit (if feature includes AI behavior)
- [ ] User is available for approval

## Vertical Slicing Best Practices

### What Makes a Good Vertical Slice?

1. **Complete:** Includes backend, frontend, tests, deployability checks, and AI layer changes when AI scope exists
2. **Deployable:** Can be released independently
3. **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria
4. **Small:** Can be completed in 2-5 days
5. **Valuable:** Delivers user value on its own

### Good Feature Examples
- ✅ "View customer list with pagination"
- ✅ "Create new order with required fields"
- ✅ "Search accounts by name"
- ✅ "View activity timeline for an account"

### Bad Feature Examples (Too Large - Break Down!)
- ❌ "Build entire customer management module"
- ❌ "Implement full order processing workflow"
- ❌ "Complete onboarding process"

### Not Vertical Slices
- ❌ "Create all database tables" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Build all backend APIs" (not vertical)
- ❌ "Create all forms" (not vertical)

## Example Usage

### Scenario 1: Customer List Feature
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer list with pagination"

Agent Runtime: [Reads feature.md]
Agent Runtime: "I'll implement the customer list feature as a vertical slice..."

[Step 0: Feature assembly planning]
  Architect:
    - Feature scope and dependencies mapped
    - Ownership assigned for backend/frontend/AI/test tasks

[Step 1: Parallel implementation]
  Backend Developer:
    - GET /api/customers endpoint with pagination
    - CustomerService.ListAsync method
    - Unit tests for service
    - Integration tests for endpoint

  Frontend Developer:
    - CustomerList component
    - TanStack Query hook for fetching customers
    - Pagination controls
    - Component tests

  Quality Engineer:
    - E2E test: View customer list
    - E2E test: Navigate pages
    - Test plan for customer list

  DevOps:
    - Container smoke test for feature runtime
    - Validate env var and compose changes
    - Record deployability evidence

[Step 2: Self-review - all pass]

[Step 3: Parallel reviews]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews complete. Results:
  - Vertical slice: Complete
  - Issues: 2 medium (naming conventions)
  - Security findings: 0 critical, 0 high, 1 low
  - Test coverage: 85%
  - Acceptance criteria: All met
  - Recommendation: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS"

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review complete. Do you approve? (approve/fix issues/reject)"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Required signoffs are complete, PM closeout and tracker sync passed. Customer list with pagination is ready to merge."
```

### Scenario 2: Iteration After Rejection
```
User: "Run the feature action for customer search"

[Steps 0.5-3 execute]

[Step 4: Approval gate]
Agent Runtime: "Feature review results:
  - Issues: 1 critical (missing authorization check)
  - Recommendation: FIX CRITICAL"

User: "fix critical"

Agent Runtime: "Fixing authorization check..."
[Backend Developer adds authorization]

[Step 3: Re-review]
Agent Runtime: "Code and security reviews updated. Results:
  - Authorization: Fixed
  - Security status: PASS
  - Recommendation: APPROVED"

[Step 4: Re-approval]
Agent Runtime: "Do you approve now?"

User: "approve"

Agent Runtime: "Required signoffs are complete, PM closeout and tracker sync passed. Feature ready."
```

## Related Actions

- **Before:** [plan action](./plan.md) - Plan the feature
- **Alternative:** [build action](./build.md) - Build multiple features together
- **After:** [document action](./document.md) - Document the feature
- **After:** [blog action](./blog.md) - Blog about the feature

---

## Notes

- Feature action is the **recommended way** to build incrementally
- Each feature should be merged to main after approval
- Features can build on each other (dependencies allowed)
- Prefer small, frequent features over large batches
- Feature action ensures true vertical slicing discipline
- Security review is part of the feature action (run `review` action separately for deeper audit scope when needed)
- DevOps deployability check is included; use `build` action for broader infra redesign across multiple features
- Critical findings block approval; high findings require explicit mitigation justification if approved
- Signoff must pass before PM closeout, and PM closeout must finish before final tracker sync
